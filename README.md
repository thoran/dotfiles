# What up, dotfiles?

## Consideration

This is really just for me. And I'll be honest and say that right now, I only even care for it to work on one particular machine.
With that said, I'm not against other people using any of this or else I wouldn't make it public. Hell, this stuff could be made
much better the more places it's used. Or at least it'll become more robust, or something.

## Appreciation

This organization was largely inspired by [Zach Holman](http://github.com/holman) and his wonderful [dotfiles](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles) repo.
There were some things I wanted to do differently. Some of those I gave up on simply because his stuff was so good.
